# TotM 

TotM or "Top of the Month" (Pronounced: "Totem") is a service for Spotify which generates you a playlist with your top 20 songs of the past month. You can subcribe to it and will automatically receive the playlist at the end of the month. The WebApp can be found under: [LINK].

Alternatively, you can let this App run on your own server. Unless you change how the database works, you will still have to use the log in function. A guide on how to set the app up on your own server is following. [WIP]
